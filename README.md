# backend
PHP Backend for Project Apex Android app

## Instructions

In order to use this, download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to your computer and run the server. 

Import the database scripts I included in the project upload zip to the database.

Place this application (backend) into the htdocs folder in the XAMPP directory (e.g C:/Users/PRJ300/xampp/htdocs).

In the server resource file in the Android app project change the API end point address to your own local IP.

You can find this file in res>values>server.xml
